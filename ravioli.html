    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>(Yields 4 servings)</p>
<ul>
    <h3>Ravioli Dough:</h3>

    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons water</li>
    
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <h3>Ravioli Filling:</h3>
    
    <li>1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
    
    <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
    
    <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    
    <li>½ cup shredded provolone cheese</li>
    
    <li>1 egg</li>
    
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley</li>
    <h3>Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce:</h3>
    
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    
    <li>3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce</li>
    
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    
    <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    
    <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
    <h3>Egg Wash:</h3>
    
    <li>1 egg</li>
    
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<h5>Step 1</h5>
<p>Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat eggs, water, and olive oil in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing egg and flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.</p>

<h5>Step 2</h5>
<p>Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>

<h5>Step 3</h5>
<p>While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Mix ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, egg, and parsley until well combined. Set the filling aside.</p>

<h5>Step 4</h5>
<p>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Stir in heavy cream, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.</p>

<h5>Step 5</h5>
<p>Meanwhile, warm marinara sauce over medium-low heat in a separate saucepan.</p>

<h5>Step 6</h5>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

<h5>Step 7</h5>
<p>Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.</p>

<h5>Step 8</h5>
<p>Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling in 1-teaspoon portions onto the dough, 1-inch apart.</p>

<h5>Step 9</h5>
<p>Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta; use your fingers to press around each portion of filling, making the seal as airtight as possible. Cut out individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Use your fingers to seal the edges.</p>

<h5>Step 10</h5>
<p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.</p>

<h5>Step 11</h5>
<p>Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.</p>

<h5>Step 12</h5>
<p>To serve, divide ravioli between four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle marinara sauce on top, followed by cream sauce.</p>
